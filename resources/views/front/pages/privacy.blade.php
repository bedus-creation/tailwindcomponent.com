    Our team genuinely writes all the articles and codes by our self. We spent hours and hours to research and code in
    Web2tailwind.com. If any posts or contents makes you feel uncomfortable to you, then feel free to reach me at <a
        href="mailto:tmgbedu@gmail.com">tmgbedu@gmail.com</a>
</p>
<p class="my-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
    Besides that Web2tailwind.com is a public platform and you can create and store your code in web2tailwind.com which
    is private by default. Private means that the content url contains hashed value which is really hard to guess and
    the content will not availble in search and it will not indexed.
